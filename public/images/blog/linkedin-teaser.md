I built my entire portfolio website by chatting with AI on my phone.

No IDE. No Figma. Just a conversation with Claude from a café in Bali.

One weekend of phone chats → a full HTML prototype → then a handover to Claude Code for a production Next.js 16 build.

The result: stellar-web.dev — scoring 100/100/100/100 on desktop Lighthouse.

I wrote about the full journey:

→ Why starting on mobile forced better decisions
→ How three theme concepts became one (and why that was the right call)
→ The CLAUDE.md file that made the handover seamless
→ A CLS bug that took days to debug (display: "optional" vs "swap" — the details matter)
→ An image format bug that appeared twice (file extensions lie, magic bytes don't)
→ Using Browser MCP + PageSpeed Insights API for the performance deep dive
→ What AI tools are great at — and where you still need human intuition

If you're a developer curious about AI-assisted development, I hope this gives you a realistic picture of what the workflow actually looks like.
